Practice: Array Iterator Methods
Instructions
Complete each of the following tasks by writing code to manipulate the provided
arrays. Your solution should only use the array methods covered in the lesson:
push(), pop(), unshift(), shift(), includes(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(),
concat(), slice(), splice(), sort(), and reverse(). Submit the final version of
the arrays as specified after each task.
Instructions
Task 1: Using forEach()
1. Create an array of five of your favorite cities.
2. Use forEach( ) to log each city name to the console in uppercase.
3. Submit the output format by adding comments to the code.
Task 2: Transforming with map()
1. Create an array called numbers with the numbers 1-5.
2. Use map( ) to create an array where each number is squared. Call this array
squares.
3. Log the new array.
4. Submit the output by adding comments to the code.
Task 3: Filtering with filter()
1. Create an array called scores containing the numbers 85, 42, 90, 75, 30, and
100.
2. Use filter ( ) to create a new array containing only the scores greater than or
equal to 80. Call this array highScores.
3. Log the new array.
4. Submit the output by adding comments to the code.

Task 4: Finding with find() and findIndex()
1. Create an array called favoriteFood that contains a list of your favorite
dishes. Try to add 5 or 6 elements.
2. Use find() to locate the first food with more than 4 letters.
3. Use findIndex( ) to find the index of that fruit.
Setup
For this activity, you will create your own repository to store your code:
1. Create a new repository.
2. Name it: practice-array-iterator-methods-[Your First Name]-[Your Last Initial]
3. Make sure the repository is public.
4. Clone the repository to your local machine.
5. Start working on the code.
Submission
Submit the url for your GitHub repo in the field bel


//Task1:

let favoriteCities = ["Hyderabad", "Paris", "Ooty", "New York", "Oklahoma"];
    favoriteCities.forEach(city => {
        console.log(city.toUpperCase());

    });/*

//Task2:

let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
let squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);
console.log(squares);/*

//Task3

let scores = [85, 42, 90, 75, 30, 100];
let highScores = scores.filter(score => score >= 80);
console.log(highScores);/*

let foodMoreThan4Letters = favoriteFood.find(food => food.length >= 4);
console.log(foodMoreThan4Letters);
let indexOfFood = favoriteFood.findIndex(food => food.length >= 4);
